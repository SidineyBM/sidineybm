I hold a Ph.D. in [Applied Mathematics](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/en/graduate/applied-mathematics) at the State University of Campinas [(Unicamp)](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/), where I researched topological, geometrical, and logical methods of non-classical phenomena, particularly contextuality, with applications in quantum resources and the foundations of physics.

I hold an M.Sc. in [Mathematics](http://www.pma.uem.br/website-in-english/home) from the State University of Maringá [(UEM)](https://www.cpr.uem.br/international/index.php/en/), with a concentration in the field of topology and geometry. In my M.Sc. research, I formally explored conformal transformations and their applications in theoretical physics, such as in relativity, quantization, conformal quantum field theory, and bosonic string theory. 

I also have a B.Sc. in [Physics](http://www.dfi.uem.br/fisica/) from the State University of Maringá [(UEM)](https://www.cpr.uem.br/international/index.php/en/), where I explored the construction of classical field theories, especially general relativity and electromagnetism.

I am a member of the Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Theory Group [(MathFoundQ)](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/~mfq/) and the National Institute of Science and Technology for Quantum Information [(INCT-IQ)](https://inctiq.if.ufrj.br/).
